# Meal Budgeter ![GitHub top language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/willwoodburn1/Group-Project-2)

## Description <!-- omit in toc -->

Our application allows users to search for specific recipes and be presented with details about said recipe including ingredients, method, and an image of the finished meal.

As a university student recently out of home, I struggle with cooking and maintaining a nutritious lifestyle. I need an application that allows me to search for recipe ideas that tailor to my budgetary constraints.

- As most people live on a budget we thought that this application could serve to aid in people’s day to day lives especially during the COVID pandemic in which funds are scarce.
- In particular this was aimed at University students who struggle to come up with cost-effective, and creating meals when living out of home.
